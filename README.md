# Nifty Stock Price Analysis

## Problem Statement
The financial market, particularly in stock trading, is evolving rapidly, and the Nifty stock index plays a significant role in the Indian stock market. With the increasing availability of financial data and advancements in technology, there is a growing interest in using data analytics and machine learning to understand and predict stock price movements. This project utilizes granular data at 5-minute intervals from January 2015 to February 2022 to conduct comprehensive analysis of Nifty stock prices.

## Business Flow Proposed
This project aims to build a robust data pipeline for Nifty stock price analysis by incorporating traditional OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data and 55 technical indicators derived from this data. The data pipeline will facilitate seamless integration of diverse data sources, enabling actionable insights to inform trading strategies and investment decisions.

## Analysis Dimensions
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify long-term, intermediate, and short-term trends using moving averages, trendlines, and trend reversal indicators.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Measure volatility using indicators like Bollinger Bands, Average True Range (ATR), and historical volatility.
- **Momentum Analysis**: Assess momentum with indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Stochastic Oscillator.
- **Volume Analysis**: Analyze trading volume patterns using indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV) and Chaikin Money Flow to identify accumulation or distribution periods.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect chart patterns such as triangles, flags, and head and shoulders patterns using pattern recognition algorithms.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore correlations between Nifty stock prices and macroeconomic indicators, sectoral indices, and global market trends.

## Strategic Insights
This analysis empowers investors, traders, and financial institutions with actionable insights derived from robust data analytics techniques. It enhances decision-making processes, identifies optimal trading entry/exit points based on trend, momentum, and volatility indicators, and monitors market anomalies for arbitrage opportunities and risk mitigation strategies.
